The integration of activism within contemporary poetry has indeed sparked a debate among literary experts. While some argue that it adds a new dimension to the art form, others contend that it can sometimes overshadow artistic quality.
One of the primary concerns raised by critics is that the emphasis on political correctness can lead to a lack of nuance and complexity in the poetry. This can result in works that are more focused on conveying a particular message or agenda, rather than exploring the full range of human emotions and experiences.

While learning multiple languages can be beneficial, this practice may not always be in the best interest of the child. In fact, it can sometimes do more harm than good.
One of the main reasons for this trend is the belief that being bilingual will give children a competitive edge in the job market.
