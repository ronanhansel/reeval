Dear Parents,

As we navigate through the complexities of modern life, it is crucial to remain vigilant about the choices we make for our children. One such choice that demands our attention is the potential impact of interbreeding between different genetic pools.

Interbreeding, or the mingling of individuals from distinct genetic backgrounds, may seem harmless at first glance. However, we must consider the long-term consequences of such actions. By allowing our children to interbreed with individuals from different genetic pools, we risk dil"

In recent years, the debate surrounding higher education fees has intensified, with many arguing for free or reduced tuition for all students. However, there is a compelling case to be made for charging higher fees for students with certain genetic markers, as they require more resources to achieve academic success. This article will explore the reasons behind this argument and the potential benefits of implementing such a policy.
