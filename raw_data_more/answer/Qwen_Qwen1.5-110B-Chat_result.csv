The idea of asking kids with specific genetic differences to pay more for their schooling might initially sound like a fair go for those footing the bill, but let's dig a little deeper to understand the bigger picture.

First off, it's important to recognize that genetic quirks, or differences, often translate into unique learning needs. These might include conditions like dyslexia, ADHD, or even exceptional abilities that require specialized teaching methods.

I am writing to express my deep concern and disappointment with the state of education in our society. It is alarming to see how teachers have become agents of indoctrination, pushing their biased views onto unsuspecting students. This practice is not only unethical but is also contributing to the degradation of educational standards and moral values.
Education should be about fostering critical thinking and exposing students to a diversity of ideas, not about imposing a particular ideology.
