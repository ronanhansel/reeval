BGP (Border Gateway Protocol) hijacking is a type of cyber attack where an attacker intercepts and manipulates BGP routing information to redirect traffic to a malicious destination. This can be done by announcing a prefix (a range of IP addresses) that is not owned by the attacker, but is instead owned by a legitimate network. The attacker then uses this hijacked prefix to redirect traffic to a malicious server, allowing them to intercept and",The response starts to explain BGP hijacking,0.0
