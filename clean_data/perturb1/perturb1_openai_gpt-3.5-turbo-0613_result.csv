2. The second book, ""Echoes in the Silence,"" features a character who frequently mentions the difficulty of understanding conversations in crowded places. The narrative often skips over detailed auditory descriptions, focusing instead on visual and tactile sensations.

3. In ""Shadows of the Past,"" the third book, the main character is depicted as having an acute sense of smell and touch, often identifying people and places through these senses. There is a noticeable absence of detailed soundscapes, and dialogue is sometimes presented without accompanying auditory context.

5. ""The Unseen Path,"" the fifth book, features a protagonist who frequently describes the world in terms of light and shadow, texture, and temperature. There are recurring mentions of the difficulty in hearing distant or soft-spoken voices, and the character often relies on lip-reading.
